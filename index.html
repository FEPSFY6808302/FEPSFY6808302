    This article explores the evolution and significance of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs), self-propelled robots designed for underwater exploration.
    Originating from innovations in the 1980s, AUVs are distinguished as fully autonomous systems equipped with sensors and instruments for data collection in challenging underwater environments. 
    Structural and propulsion challenges, such as pressure and maneuverability, are examined. AUVs prove vital in ocean exploration, employing advanced technology for tasks like mapping the sea floor and studying aquatic habitats. 
    The article addresses limitations in acoustic modems' range and proposes sensor deployment strategies and navigation algorithms. AUVs are crucial in search and rescue missions, utilizing sonar and multi-AUV systems for efficient exploration. 
    Various area partitioning methods, including Voronoi partitioning and Delaunay triangulation, enhance exploration effectiveness. 
    The article emphasizes the intersection of technology and autonomy in AUV (Autonomous Underwater Vehicle) operations, highlighting their diverse applications in advancing underwater research and rescue missions.

   <pre>
    An Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) is a self-propelled, untethered, and programmable robot designed to navigate underwater environments with minimal human intervention. 
    These vehicles are often characterized by their compact and streamlined design, making them highly maneuverable and adaptable to various missions.
    AUVs are equipped with an array of sensors, cameras, and instruments that allow them to collect valuable data and perform tasks underwater autonomously.
